This is a Python program that pulls definitions from a list and outputs them to a text file. 
There are two versions, one with a GUI, and one with a CLI (command line interface). Choose
whichever seems most appropriate for you.

To read words from a text file, the following configuration should be used:
word1,word2,word3

Otherwise, the program will not be able to parse your file and most likely crash.
